Recommendation System For OTT Based VOD Contents

#TOC
Let's articulate the problem - "One line problem"IntroductionWhat is OTT and what are the famous player out there - Netflix, Zee5, AltBalaji etcWhat is a Recommendation System and how does it work for OTT and VOD Content and where it is used - business use cases - Recommending products in Amazon FireTV, Netflix, Zee5, Alt Balaji etc.Refine the problem statement and talk about it briefly hereWhat is a CMS for OTT and How do you want to build a recommendation system to power the CMS to recommend VOD ContentAI / ML in Recommendation SystemsA brief introduction into AI, ML and Types of Learning - Supervised, Semi-Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement learningLet's look at various approaches/techniques for recommendation systemsSupervised, Deep Learning, NN etcLet's look at the approaches of testing the algorithms/models for accuracyWhat is the final level of accuracy desiredLet's finalize the approach that we are going to perform for the recommendation systemData Sources and Publicly Available Data Sources: Kaggle, Fast.ai etc..(SM to provide and RR also to Investigate)
