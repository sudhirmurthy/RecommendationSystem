# RecommendationSystem
Recommendation System For OTT Based VOD Contents

#TOC
1.	Let's articulate the problem - "One line problem"
2.  Introduction
  2.1 What is OTT and what are the famous player out there - Netflix, Zee5, AltBalaji etc
  2.2 What is a Recommendation System and how does it work for OTT and VOD Content and where it is used - business use cases -    Recommending products in Amazon FireTV, Netflix, Zee5, Alt Balaji etc.
   2.3 Refine the problem statement and talk about it briefly here
   2.4 What is a CMS for OTT and How do you want to build a recommendation system to power the CMS to recommend VOD Content
   2.5 AI / ML in Recommendation Systems
   2.6 A brief introduction into AI, ML and Types of Learning - Supervised, Semi-Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement learning
3. Let's look at various approaches/techniques for recommendation systems
    -Supervised, Deep Learning, NN etc
4. Let's look at the approaches of testing the algorithms/models for accuracy
    What is the final level of accuracy desired?
5. Let's finalize the approach that we are going to perform for the recommendation system
